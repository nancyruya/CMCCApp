      When I was a baby
Playing piano

As you can see from the background, it is messy and shuttered. But there seems always a music instrument in this kind of environment through out my life. Now I am thinking if god had sent music as a present to me in my life. <br> My family seems always struggle, no matter what situation, they can find a way to struggle. Perhaps that is true. <br> Just few minutes ago, father was complaining the difficulties of renting an apartment and buying a house. We ended up yelling at each other and he hunged up the phone. I guess he has so much pressure taken within himself and he is not communicating out. I somehow think my mother is responsible to take part of the responsibility but my mother lost love. They are never happy. I can see from my sister that she is picking up with this unhappiness. My sister is so strong and she is always finding way to be happy. The other day when she wakeup, she was silently looking at the window for quite a while and ended up with tears. She is only 6 years old. I don't think my parents they realize the issue. I wonder what I can do to help them.
