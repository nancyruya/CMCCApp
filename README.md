### Django
###### Ideally: use Django to build a website to demostrate how the case management and care coordination app is going to work - I still have no idea what the app is going to look like.
- Phone number should be able to connect with cell phone and directly call patient from the app, video calling is even better. Providers can access it when it is necessary for patient.

- Address should be able to connect to google map.

- Patient categorization base on need - assessment tool(and barriers, acuity, intensity, deadline) - mental health need vs medical need

- Interpretation tool!!

- Tasks reminder for care plan implementation and creation.

- Appointment tracking-how?

- ER visit tracking-how? and follow up 

- Patient's providers tree and should be easy to use to connect virtually

- Patient's input for issues

- Resources for patient including health insurance, INN providers, social services... Reminder for patient.............................

- Assignment tool for other people to assist with specific tasks

- Event annnouncement for group meetup, etc

###### Reality: image uploaded to postgreSQL but not shown in html page; page url-id not connected. -- not important yet
